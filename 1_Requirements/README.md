# Introduction:

In Educational institute the information of some general details like student name, roll number, address, performance, contact number  are maintained manually. Hence they need to be automated and centralized as, Information from one module will be needed by other modules. For example when a student needs his course completion certificate it needs to check many details about the student like his name, performance status  and many other details. So in order to maintain these information this project can be used. Another major advantage of this project is that these information can also be reviewed or edited based on requirements.
